## Hosting and Content Delivery Network (CDN)

Our host Cloudflare (Cloudflare Germany GmbH, Rosental 7, c/o Mindspace, 80331 Munich, Germany) collects the following data transmitted by your browser in so-called log files:

- IP address
- The address of the previously visited website (Referer Request Header)
- Date and time of the request
- Time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time
- Content of the request
- HTTP status code
- Transferred amount of data
- Website from which the request comes
- Information about browser and operating system

This is necessary to display our website, ensure stability and security, and increase delivery speed through the Content Delivery Network (CDN). This corresponds to our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. A CDN is a network of globally distributed servers that can optimally deliver content to website users.

No tracking occurs and we have no direct access to this data. The log files are deleted after a maximum of 25 hours.

The processing by Cloudflare corresponds to our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR in not having to maintain server infrastructure and a Content Delivery Network on our own premises.

You have the right to object to the processing. Whether the objection is successful must be determined as part of a balancing of interests.

The data will be deleted as soon as the purpose for processing ceases to apply. Personal data is stored by Cloudflare only as long as necessary for the described purposes.

The processing of the data specified in this section is neither legally nor contractually required. The functionality of the website cannot be guaranteed without the processing.

Cloudflare has implemented compliance measures for international data transfers. These apply to all worldwide activities where Cloudflare processes personal data of natural persons in the EU. These measures are based on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) and participation in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework.

## Your Rights as a Data Subject

As a data subject, you have the right to information, the right to rectification or erasure, the right to restriction of processing, and the right to object to the processing of your data. If you have given us consent, you can revoke it at any time with effect for the future.

Please send your objection or revocation informally to the above address of the Data Controller via (E-)Mail.

Furthermore, you have the right to data portability. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority about the processing.

## Legal Note

In principle, a data processing agreement must be concluded with the host. The Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision has made an exception for hosting purely static websites.

In cases where the website serves self-presentation purposes, e.g., for associations or small businesses, no personal data flows to the operator, and no tracking takes place, there is no commissioned data processing. It further states: "The fact that IP addresses, i.e., personal data, must necessarily be processed even when hosting static websites does not lead to the assumption of commissioned data processing. This would not be appropriate. The (short-term) storage of IP addresses is rather to be attributed to the telecommunications access mediation of the website host according to the TKG and primarily serves the host's security purposes.

We assume that this exception applies to Cloudflare Pages.
